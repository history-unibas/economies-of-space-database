## Database Schema 
The following figure shows all entities defined in the project database and their links to each other. Reading example for the link between StABS_Series and StABS_Dossier: An entry of the entity StABS_Series is connected to one or more entries of the entity StABS_Dossier. Conversely, an entry of the StABS_Dossier entity is related to exactly one entry of the StABS_Series entity.

![entityRelations](entityRelations.drawio.svg)

The tables StABS_Series and StABS_Dossier containing metadata from the Historical Land Registry (HGB) available as linked open data by the State Archives of Basel.

The tables with the prefix project contain processed data relevant to our research project.

For our research project, the images of the register cards of the historical land registry are stored and processed on the platform Transkribus (https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/). Selected information from Transkribus is additionally written into the tables Transkribus_Collection, Transkribus_Document, Transkribus_Page, Transkribus_Page, and Transkribus_TextRegion respectively, for analyses.

Entities with the prefix Geo contain geodata.

## administrateDatabase.py
This script contains functions creating the project database and its schema and to administrate it using Python scripts.

## connectDatabase.py
Functions to read and write to database tables as well as functions to check if a database exist or a table is empty are defined in this script.

## dossier_realtionship.py
This script is used to determine relationships between dossiers. On the one hand, relationships between dossiers that follow one another in time. On the other hand, clusters of dossiers that are related to each other by address.

## dossier_validity_range.py
This script is used to determine validity ranges of dossiers and to detect possible errors.

## project_database_update.py
This script allows to create and update the project database. The data sources used are metadata of the Historical Land Registry of the City of Basel and data from the Transkribus platform. The script uses functions from the following repositories:
- https://github.com/history-unibas/Metadata-Historical-Land-Registry-Basel
- https://github.com/history-unibas/Trankribus-API

## year_analysis.py
This module analyses a variable year based on transcribed text. In the project database, this attribute is stored in the entity project_entry.
